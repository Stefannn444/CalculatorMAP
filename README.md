# Calculator App
A Windows-inspired Calculator app, developed by means of C# and WPF (.NET), part of my university's Advanced Programming Environments Course

## Features 
* **MVVM Architecture**
* **Display and Expression List**: suggestive display of the current input. The operations are executed in the order of insertion (ie: 3+2*4 will equal 24, akin to the standard calculator calculation method)
* **Standard Mode**: supporting typical calculator operations
* **Programmer Mode**: supporting conversions to **binary**, **octodecimal**,**decimal**,**hexadecimal** number bases
* **Memory Operations**: the option to save results in the memory and manipulate them
* **Digit Grouping**: the option to group digits, based on the system's **culture info**
* **Persistence**: Digit Grouping, Standard/Programmer Mode, the number base are all **persisted** between launches

## Installation
* Clone this repository
* Build and run the app.
